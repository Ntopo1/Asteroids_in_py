In this project I am going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroid. The learning goals of this project are:

    Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
    Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming

This project was a ton of fun! pygame is a great way to visually represent your code. This was a great excercise by [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/5be3e3bd-efb5-4664-a9e9-7111be783271). There was a lot of trial and error but all in all it was a great project.
